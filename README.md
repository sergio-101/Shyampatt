# Shyampatt

A blackboard.
Built in **C** Because Fuck **Java-Web-Type-Dev-Script**, That's Why.

## What It Does

You can:

* Draw rectangles | Ellipses | Lines |  Arrows
* Select | Drag | Resize | Delete
* Move the entire board (FOV)

Yes, I kinda hate right clicks.

## Controls (memorize these)

```
DRAW               -> Click + Drag
LOCK SHAPE         -> CTRL + Draw
SELECT             -> CLICK ON EDGE
MOVE OBJECT        -> SELECT + DRAG (from inside)
RESIZE RECT/EL     -> SELECT + Drag edges or corners
RESHAPE LINE       -> SELECT + Drag endpoints
CHANGE SHAPE       -> Scroll OR 1–4
DELETE             -> Delete
MOVE BOARD (FOV)   -> SPACE + Drag
```

If you forget them, the app literally shows them in the center.


## Build & Run

```bash
./build.sh && ./run.sh
```

Make sure `Raylib` exists.

If it doesn’t, that’s on you.
